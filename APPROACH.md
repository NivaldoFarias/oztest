# Technical Approach

## Stack Choices & Rationale

### Runtime & Build

- **Build Tool**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (for development and bundling)
- **Production Runtime**: Node.js 20+ (as required)
- **Package Manager**: [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

### Framework & Libraries

- **API Framework**: [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) _(in place of Express)_
- **ORM**: [Typegoose](https://typegoose.com/)
- **Database**: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Technical Decisions

1. Using Bun as build tool while targeting Node.js runtime for production
2. Choosing Fastify over Express for better TypeScript support and performance
3. [Other key decisions...]

## Development Workflow

1. Local development using Bun
2. Testing with Bun test runner
3. Building with Bun targeting Node.js
4. Production deployment running on Node.js 20+
